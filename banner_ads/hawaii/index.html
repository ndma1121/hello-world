            <span id="aloha">"Aloha"</span><br><br>The word Aloha is known worldwide. This is because anyone who visits Hawaii becomes charmed by the incredible beauty of these isolated islands. Aside from the standard “hello and goodbye” definition of the word there lies a much deeper meaning. <br> <br> Ancient Hawaiians held strong beliefs about the land and because they had no written language they became masters of storytelling and recounting history through chants and legends. The spirit of Aloha was like a cultural guidance system for ancient Hawaiians who taught their children “The Ways of Aloha”.
