      <p class="header-not-bold">Nicole Breanne Donnelly, <br><br>

        The day that I met you, I knew you were special. I swear, you are a magnet; you pull me closer and closer everyday and I can't stand to be away from you. The very first time I heard that infectious laugh of yours from across the room, my life was changed forever. I stand here, knowing in my heart, that not one has ever been luckier than me.<br><br>
      
        In you, I see everything I want for the rest of my life. You are passion incarnate! You are spontaneous, adventurous, brilliant, hysterical, and fiery, which makes sense because when I look at you I feel an overwhelming sense of warmth. You make me feel calm and allow me to be truly open and vulnerable like I have never been before. I promise that will never change. You are my home, the fire to my water, and the copywriter to my account executive.<br><br>
      
        You are the soul I want to grow old with, even if we watch Twilight for the rest of our lives. You are the one who made me excited to start a family for the first time in my life. You are the one who pushes me to be more ambitious, to be more spontaneous and open. You make me want to be a better person. You bring me more happiness than I ever knew existed and you do it without trying. All I ever want is for you to have everything you deserve in this life because you give me everything each and every day. I must tell you, "I love you" 50 times per day and I feel like that is not even 5% of how much I should be saying it. What is scary to me is that no matter how much I say or do, I feel like you deserve more, but I will never stop trying to give you the world, even though you always say my love is all you ever need.<br><br>
      
        I have said this to you before and I promise you it will forever be true. If I can make you smile everyday for the rest of my life, it will have been a life worth living. I vow to fill your life with warmth, safety, loyalty, and happiness. I vow to stand with you as a united front through every up and down we may go through. I vow to always be your biggest fan and always cover you with the warmest blankets possible. I vow to love you with all the force of every waterfall we have ever seen combined with every volcano we have ever been on. I vow to be yours forever.
